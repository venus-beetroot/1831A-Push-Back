## Welcome To the 1831 Common Codebase! üî•üöÄ

Welcome Adventurer! This repository is a merged effort between programmers of active V5RC teams **1831E and 1831A** in the "high stakes" season. 

With this project, we are aiming to extend upon the existing LemLib project by @SizzinSeal and its contributors, optimising it for the "high stakes" season. 

If you decide to use our code, please consider **starring our project** (and lemlib) to support us!
